Please mark `/src` folder as source code folder.

You can also use menu `Build > Recompile {TargetClass}` in IntelliJ IDEA to recompile the code ignoring 
any build errors in other parts of the project. Then you can adjust `Application` run configuration
by enabling 'Do not build before run' to avoid compilation errors on running the main method in the target class.
